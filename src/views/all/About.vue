        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">FAQs</h2>
        <ul class="space-y-4">
          <li class="font-bold">What is a Native-owned business?</li>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal mb-6">A Native-owned businsess is a business whose owners are majority Native and whose business proclaims to be Native-owned or whose majority owners have Native citizenship.</p>
          <li class="font-bold">I am a Native business owner. How do I sign up?</li>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal mb-6">The process for signing up is manual for now. If you are a Native-owned business then please send an email to <a class="underline" href="mailto:nob@nativesintech.org">nob@nativesintech.org</a> with your name, email, and nation so that we can add you to the directory.</p>
          <li class="font-bold">I have citizenship in a nation but it is not recognized or I am a citizen of a state recognized nation. Can I still be added to the directory?</li>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal mb-6">It depends. There are nations such as the <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://indianlaw.org/projects/past_projects/seminole">Independent Traditional Seminole Nation</a> who do not believe in citizenship and who follow a traditional way of life. In contrast, there also exists wannabe cultures who reframe and adopt native cultures but who do not have a connection to any Native community. We will do our best to preserve the integrity of this directory and do our research on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <li class="font-bold">I can't find a business for x. Why don't you have it?</li>
          <p class="text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal mb-6">In order to maintain the integrity of this directory we are adding business owners manually. It will take time for the spectrum of businesses to show up here.</p>
